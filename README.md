# Matrix multiplier

Task for Fortran classes


### Prerequisites

- Installed newest version of `ifort`

- Installed newest version of `phunit`

- Added proper path im `makefile`


### Running
As runnging might be quite tricky, I strongly advice you te jupyter-notebook file attached where everything should be explained
I do not consider as crucial to write it here as.

### Graphs
Made in `jupyter notebook`
Given you have installed `jupyter notebook` and all python3 related stuff, type 
```
jupyter notebook
```
in main directory

You could watch given graphs or change something and generate them on your own. However, then you need to have `matplotlib` to print beautiful graphs :tada:


Let you consider that I'm not a master in python so I suppose that everything I did could have been done better :dog:
